        <h1>Bugzilla Status Update</h1>
<a href="http://www.steenhagen.us/~jake/blog/">Jacob Steenhagen</a> and
<a href="../developers/profiles.html">The Bugzilla Team</a>
<p><b>Tuesday, May 11, 2005</b></p>

<p><a href="./">Previous Updates</a></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The previous three months have seen some of the most active Bugzilla
development in history. The 2.20 release is promising to be very impressive. The
team has been hard at work to bring long awaited features such as bugmail
threading support and an optional third level of classification (in addition
to the current Products and Components).
</p>

<p>If you're looking to get more involved in the actual development of
Bugzilla, you may wish to consider joining the
<a href="https://lists.bugzilla.org/cgi-bin/mj_wwwusr?func=lists-long-full&extra=developers">developer's list</a>.
This higher volume list is used by the development team to discuss many aspects
of the development process and Bugzilla's future.</p>

<h2>New Releases</h2>

<h3>2.18.1</h3>
2.18.1 is our first bug-fix release for 2.18. Overall, the initial 2.18
release proved to be pretty stable, but a few polishes and bug-fixes made
their way into 2.18.1, and we do encourage anybody running 2.18 to update
to 2.18.1.</p>

<h3>2.19.3</h3>

<p>The latest in our bleeding edge trunk development is now 2.19.3. This
version has seen significant changes since 2.19.2 was released and, once fully
stable, will become 2.20. Like all development releases, this has received
much less testing than a stable release. Because of the feverish pace of
development during this latest cycle, this version is actually slightly less
stable than a typical development release.</p>

<p>If you are currently running 2.19.2, this update to 2.19.3 should be
considered &quot;at your own risk.&quot; The pace of
development between 2.19.2 and 2.19.3 has been frenzied and there could
still be issues in the code. If you are willing to try out 2.19.3 and help
us with the regression testing, it would be most appreciated. Remember that
development snapshots are not recommended for production use unless you have
a competent Perl programmer available. They may work perfectly well, but 
they've had less testing.</p>

<h2>Security Bugs Fixed</h2>
<p>We fixed two minor security issues in our three most recent releases.
See the <a href="../security/2.16.8/">Security Advisory</a> for details.</p>

<h2>Major Recent Developments</h2>

<h3>Internal API Changes</h3>

<p>In order to better facilitate future changes to the code many of
Bugzilla's internal functions have been moved into modules and/or changed
names. This will not matter to the average user of Bugzilla; however, this
may cause some minor problems for administrators who have made customizations
to the code of their local installation. This has also caused many patches
on <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org">bugzilla.mozilla.org</a> to no
longer apply cleanly.</p>

<p>However, these internal APIs are expected to remain fairly stable
between now and the final release of 2.20.</p>

<h3>Cross-Database Compatability</h3>

<p>The team is very excited to see one of the most requested changes to
Bugzilla finally starting to take shape. While it's not likely to be fully
supported for the 2.20 release, there has been major progress made toward
allowing Bugzilla to run on more than just the MySQL database server. We have
decided to start the database portability with PostgreSQL, but we won't stop
there. Once the infrastructure is fully in place, it will make adding support
for other ANSI compatible database servers trivial.</p>

<p>The 2.19.3 development release is the first official release that is able to
create a database on PostgreSQL. However, we recommend doing this only if you
are interested in helping to test Bugzilla on PostgreSQL as there are still
significant features of Bugzilla that do not work on PostgreSQL.
Also, there is very little support for actually using Bugzilla with a 
PostgreSQL database at this time. Official support for
running Bugzilla on PostgreSQL is coming soon, but it's not here yet. Anybody
wishing to assist with the development and/or testing of PostgreSQL support is
encouraged to watch
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=98304">bug 98304</a>
and all of its blockers.</p>

<h4>Help us out with other databases</h4>

<p>If you have some other database you'd like to see supported, please
let us know! It is not hard to write a new component for Bugzilla for
a new database. We already have bugs filed for support for: 
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=189947">Oracle</a>,
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=249400">Ingres</a>,
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=173130">Sybase</a>,
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=249254">Firebird</a>,
and <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=285122">MS-SQL</a>.

<p>However, they all need somebody to work on them! If you're interested,
come talk to us in #mozwebtools on irc.mozilla.org, or tell us on the
<a href="https://lists.bugzilla.org/cgi-bin/mj_wwwusr?func=lists-long-full&extra=developers">developer's list</a>.
</p>


<h3>Ability to Upgrade from 2.8 Restored</h3>

<p>Starting with 2.18.1 and 2.19.3, you can now successfully upgrade from
 the very old Bugzilla 2.8. Upgrading from Bugzilla 2.8 has been broken 
 for a while, but now that it's fixed, this is definitely a good time 
 to upgrade. Such old releases have many security issues which have 
 been fixed in newer releases.</p>

<h2>Upcoming Events and Changes</h2>

<h3>MySQL 3.23 Support Deprecated</h3>

<p>The decision has been made in
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=204217">bug 204217</a>
to no longer support MySQL 3.23 in future releases. 2.20 and all its point
releases will continue to be fully supported on MySQL 3.23.41 and above, but
the minimum version will be bumped to 4.0.2 early on in the 2.21 development
cycle.
</p>

<h3>Upcoming UI Hackathons</h3>

<p>Myk Melez has proposed that early in the development for 2.22 that the
Bugzilla team should focus on making large improvements to the User Interface.
His proposal for this is to have a number of weekly hackathons where teams of
people agree to dedicate time to discussing UI improvements, coding them,
reviewing them, and getting them checked in. Under this proposal, the
<a href="../developers">normal procedures</a> would still apply, but by having
reviewers and approvers on hand, they could be greatly accelerated. For more
information, see the archive of
<a href="https://lists.bugzilla.org/cgi-bin/mj_wwwusr?list=developers&brief=on&func=archive-get-part&extra=200503/18">Myk's post</a> to the Developer's list</a>.



<h2>Continuing to Support the 2.16 Branch</h2>

<p>Official support on the 2.16 branch for security issues and major bugs will
continue until 2.22 is released, which is currently projected for sometime in
November 2005. Our hope is that this will give our current 2.16 users enough
time to plan an upgrade to one of the other supported versions.
</p>

<h2>Dave's Corner</h2>
<p><b>An update from Dave Miller, Project Leader</b></p>

<p>There has been a lot happening in the last six months, both with myself
and with Bugzilla.  Shortly before Bugzilla 2.18 released, I got hired
by the Mozilla Foundation as a system administrator.  This has been a
most rewarding and challenging experience for me!  However, being
that we've been a bit shorthanded, I've actually wound up with less
time to spend on Bugzilla instead of more, despite heading up the 
Bugzilla project actually being part of my job description.  
We currently have a position posted on our
<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/foundation/careers.html">careers</a> page to get some 
additional help, and we also have an intern this summer, so I'm 
confident that it's temporary, but in the meantime I've felt like the 
Bugzilla project hasn't been getting anywhere near the kind of attention 
it deserves from me lately.</p>

<p>I had some family issues to deal with that came up during our final 
push to release version 2.18, and that prompted me to make a desperate 
cry for help getting the release out the door.  Max Kanat-Alexander came 
to my rescue and coordinated the efforts of several others who also pitched 
in, and most of the 2.18 release was pulled off without my having to do
anything other than roll the tarballs and post stuff that was handed to 
me onto the website.  Max did an awesome job with this, and I invited him 
to become the release manager for Bugzilla, which he graciously accepted.  
Max is a former technical support manager for a large software company 
best known for their mail server products, and recently gave that up 
to start a new <a href="http://www.everythingsolved.com/">consulting 
company</a>, which among other things, specializes 
in Bugzilla.  The 2.18.1 and 2.19.3 release is entirely his doing!  It's 
my great pleasure to have him taking on this responsibility, and helping 
reinvigorate the Bugzilla project, and helping so many of our contributors 
get their patches reviewed!</p>

<p>On to other news...  if you haven't already noticed, we are running 
slightly late with the 2.20 release.  Most of this is a result of the 
cross-database compatibility code being taken in.  At the point it was 
time to freeze, it was so close, and such a big deal, that we just 
couldn't turn it away.  With all of the incredible work that's gone in 
since 2.19.2, I'm confident that you'll agree that the extra wait for 
2.20 was well worth it once you get your hands on it.  Barring any 
major regressions getting reported from the 2.19.3 release, we 
should have a 2.20 release candidate within the next few weeks, 
and a final release not too long after.</p>
