<h2>Introduction and Updates</h2>

<p>Today is the release of our first major feature update since 3.0,
  <a href="../releases/3.2/">Bugzilla 3.2</a>! This status update will
  tell you a bit about Bugzilla 3.2, talk about some of its new features,
  and then talk about the road to Bugzilla 4.0.</p>

<h2>About Bugzilla 3.2</h2>

<p>3.2 has a <em>lot</em> of new features. In many ways, this is one of
  the releases that we've put the most "polish" into. After conquering
  a lot of major obstacles and doing lots of code clean-up to prepare
  for the Bugzilla 3.0 series, we were finally able to focus on a lot
  of usability issues and annoyances that we've always wanted to fix.</p>

<p>For example, we cleaned up the <kbd>show_bug.cgi</kbd> UI, and thanks
  to the new UI, you can change the status of a bug and reassign it at
  the same time. We added mid-air collision protection to attachment
  updates. The Diff Viewer shows the line numbers of the files that
  are being patched. And <em>lots</em> of other great improvements that
  will be appreciated by long-term users and new users alike, on top of
  all the <a href="../releases/3.2/new-features.html">new major features</a>
  that we added.</p>

<h2>Bugzilla 3.2 Has Oracle Support</h2>

<p>So, Bugzilla 3.2 is our first release to support Oracle as a database
  backend. It took a <em>lot</em> of work to support Oracle for this
  release, and we're grateful that Oracle Corp. provided a developer
  to implement those changes.</p>

<p>Now, Bugzilla is an open-source project, and we don't advocate using
  proprietary database systems. We'd still recommend that new Bugzilla
  installations use MySQL or PostgreSQL, if you can. However, if your
  company uses Oracle and can't use anything else, now you can use
  Bugzilla!</p>

<p>Note that implementing Oracle support in Bugzilla was very complex, and
  so for Bugzilla 3.2, we're only saying that we have "experimental" support
  for it. We're aware of some bugs, and there may be other bugs we're not
  aware of. However, we're not aware of any <em>major</em> issues that would
  totally prevent an organization from using Bugzilla on Oracle.</p>

<h2>The Road to Bugzilla 4.0</h2>

<p>So, after we branched for 3.2, we wrote out a 
  <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Bugzilla:Roadmap">roadmap for Bugzilla 4.0</a>.
  For Bugzilla 4.0, our focus is <em>inter-Bugzilla communication</em> and
  <em>integration</em>. That is, the ability for other tools to talk to
  Bugzilla, and for two Bugzilla installations to talk to each other.
  We want to have a greatly-improved WebServices interface for Bugzilla 4.0,
  among other features.</p>

<p>However, as we started to work toward these goals, it became apparent
  that they were too large for us to complete in one release cycle--we'd
  be waiting a year or two in order to get out Bugzilla 4.0, and we want
  to do regular releases.</p>

<p>So what we've decided is that Bugzilla 4.0 is a "feature-based release"--that
  is, we won't call Bugzilla "4.0" until we actually achieve our roadmap.
  The roadmap may change somewhat between now and 4.0, but we still have
  to finish whatever's on the roadmap to get to 4.0.</p>

<p>In the mean time, until we achieve those features, we are going to do
  <em>time-based</em> releases in the 3.x series. So, for example, we are
  going to freeze for 3.4 exactly <em>two months</em> after 3.2 is released,
  no matter what features 3.4 has at that time.</p>

<p>So, what you should be seeing from us in the near future are faster,
  smaller major releases, where we have a new major release approximately
  every six months, which is what we always wanted to do anyway. Then,
  after several of these smaller releases we will eventually reach the
  feature set required for 4.0, and that release will be called 4.0.</p>

<p>This whole system is an experiment, so if it doesn't work we might change
  our plans. But these are our plans for now.</p>

<h2>Bugzilla 2.20 Series End of Life</h2>

<p>Now Bugzilla 3.2 final is released, the Bugzilla 2.20 series has reached
  End Of Life, meaning that no future security or bug fixes will be issued
  for 2.20 installations. We strongly advise Bugzilla administrators to
  upgrade their installations to version 3.2.</p>

<h2>Stay Updated About Bugzilla</h2>

<p>As usual, we'd like to remind all Bugzilla administrators that to assist
  them in keeping up-to-date with release announcements and security
  advisories, we provide an ultra-low-volume administrator mailing list
  (<a href="https://lists.bugzilla.org/cgi-bin/mj_wwwusr?func=lists-full-long&amp;extra=announce">announce@bugzilla.org</a>). 
  We advise all Bugzilla administrators to subscribe so they can keep up 
  with important Bugzilla announcements.</p>

<p>Those looking to get involved with Bugzilla development may want to
  consider joining the <a href="https://lists.bugzilla.org/cgi-bin/mj_wwwusr?func=lists-long-full&amp;extra=developers">developers list (developers@bugzilla.org)</a>.
  This list offers discussion on new features and issues. Developers are
  invited to subscribe to the list. You may also want to read our 
  <a href="https://www.bugzilla.org/docs/contributor.html">Contributor's Guide</a>.
  You might also want to contribute to other
  <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Bugzilla:Bugzilla:Teams">Bugzilla areas</a>.</p>

<h2>Bugzilla Meetings</h2>

<p>Come to our <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Bugzilla:Meetings">meetings</a>
every month! Anybody is welcome to attend who is interested in helping
out with the Bugzilla Project, or just anybody who wants to put in their
two cents on how development should go.</p>

<p>You can learn more about the meetings at the 
  <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Bugzilla:Meetings">wiki page about 
  Bugzilla Meetings</a>.</p>
