<h3><a name="v30_feat_cf"></a>Custom Fields</h3>

<p>Bugzilla now includes very basic support for custom fields.</p>

<p>Users in the <kbd>admin</kbd> group can add plain-text or drop-down
  custom fields. You can edit the values available for drop-down fields
  using the "Field Values" control panel.</p>

<p>Don't add too many custom fields! It can make Bugzilla
  very difficult to use. Try your best to get along with the default
  fields, and then if you find that you can't live without custom fields
  after a few weeks of using Bugzilla, only then should you
  start your custom fields.</p>

<h3><a name="v30_feat_mp"></a>mod_perl Support</h3>

<p>Bugzilla 3.0 supports mod_perl, which allows for extremely
  enhanced page-load performance. mod_perl trades memory usage for performance,
  allowing near-instantaneous page loads, but using much more memory.</p>

<p>If you want to enable mod_perl for your Bugzilla, we recommend
  a minimum of 1.5GB of RAM, and for a site with heavy traffic, 4GB to 8GB.</p>

<p>If performance isn't that critical on your installation, you don't
  have the memory, or you are running some other web server than
  Apache, Bugzilla still runs perfectly as a normal CGI
  application, as well.</p>

<h3><a name="v30_feat_sq"></a>Shared Saved Searches</h3>

<p>Users can now choose to "share" their saved searches
  with a certain group. That group will then be able to 
  "subscribe" to those searches, and have them appear
  in their footer.</p>

<p>If the sharer can "bless" the group he's sharing to,
  (that is, if he can add users to that group), it's considered
  that he's a manager of that group, and his queries show up
  automatically in that group's footer (although they can
  unsubscribe from any particular search, if they want.)</p>

<p>In order to allow a user to share their queries, they also
  have to be a member of the group specified in the 
  <code>querysharegroup</code> parameter.</p>

<p>Users can control their shared and subscribed queries from
  the "Preferences" screen.</p>

<h3><a name="v30_feat_afn"></a>Attachments and Flags on New Bugs</h3>

<p>You can now add an attachment while you are filing a new bug.</p>

<p>You can also set flags on the bug and on attachments, while
  filing a new bug.</p>

<h3><a name="v30_feat_cr"></a>Custom Resolutions</h3>

<p>You can now customize the list of resolutions available
  in Bugzilla, including renaming the default resolutions.</p>

<p>The resolutions <code>FIXED</code>, <code>DUPLICATE</code>
  and <code>MOVED</code> have a special meaning to Bugzilla,
  though, and cannot be renamed or deleted.</p>

<h3><a name="v30_feat_ppp"></a>Per-Product Permissions</h3>

<p>You can now grant users <kbd>editbugs</kbd> and <kbd>canconfirm</kbd>
  for only certain products. You can also grant users <kbd>editcomponents</kbd>
  on a product, which means they will be able to edit that product
  including adding/removing components and other product-specific
  controls.</p>

<h3><a name="v30_feat_ui"></a>User Interface Improvements</h3>

<p>There has been some work on the user interface for Bugzilla 3.0,
  including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>There is now navigation and a search box a the <em>top</em> of
    each page, in addition to the bar at the bottom of the page.</li>
  <li>A re-designed "Format for Printing" page for bugs.</li>
  <li>The layout of <kbd>show_bug.cgi</kbd> (the bug editing 
    page) has been changed, and the attachment table has been redesigned.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="v30_feat_xml"></a>XML-RPC Interface</h3>

<p>Bugzilla now has a Web Services interface using the XML-RPC
  protocol. It can be accessed by external applications by going
  to the <kbd>xmlrpc.cgi</kbd> on your installation.</p>

<p>Documentation can be found in the 
  <a href="https://www.bugzilla.org/docs/3.0/html/api/">Bugzilla 
  API Docs</a>, in the various <kbd>Bugzilla::WebService</kbd> modules.</p>

<h3><a name="v30_feat_skin"></a>Skins</h3>

<p>Bugzilla can have multiple "skins" installed,
  and users can pick between them. To write a skin, you just have to
  write several CSS files. See the <a href="https://www.bugzilla.org/docs/3.0/html/cust-skins.html">Custom
  Skins Documentation</a> for more details.</p>

<p>We currently don't have any alternate skins shipping withBugzilla. If you write an alternate skin, please
  let us know!</p>

<h3><a name="v30_feat_sbu"></a>Unchangeable Fields Appear
  Unchangeable</h3>

<p>As long as you are logged in, when viewing a bug, if you 
  cannot change a field, it will not look like you can change it. That 
  is, the value will just appear as plain text.</p>

<h3><a name="v30_feat_et"></a>All Emails in Templates</h3>

<p>All outbound emails are now controlled by the templating system.
  What used to be the <code>passwordmail</code>, <code>whinemail</code>,
  <code>newchangedmail</code> and <code>voteremovedmail</code>
  parameters are now all templates in the <kbd>template/</kbd> directory.</p>

<p>This means that it's now much easier to customize your outbound
  emails, and it's also possible for localizers to have more
  localized emails as part of their language packs, if they want.</p>

<p>We also added a <code>mailfrom</code> parameter to let you set
  who shows up in the <code>From</code> field on all emails that
  Bugzilla sends.</p>

<h3><a name="v30_feat_df"></a>No More Double-Filed Bugs</h3>

<p>Users of Bugzilla will sometimes accidentally submit a bug twice, either by going back in their web browser, 
  or just by refreshing a page. In the past, this could file the same bug twice (or even three times) in a row, irritating 
  developers and confusing users.</p>

<p>Now, if you try to submit a bug twice from the same screen 
  (by going back or by refreshing the page), Bugzilla will warn 
  you about what you're doing, before it actually submits the duplicate
  bug.</p>

<h3><a name="v30_feat_cc"></a>Default CC List for Components</h3>

<p>You can specify a list of users who will <em>always</em> be added to
  the CC list of new bugs in a component.</p>

<h3><a name="v30_feat_emi"></a>File/Modify Bugs By Email</h3>

<p>You can now file or modify bugs via email. Previous versions
  of Bugzilla included this feature only as an
  unsupported add-on, but it is now an official interface to
  Bugzilla.</p>

<p>For more details see the <a href="https://www.bugzilla.org/docs/3.0/html/api/email_in.html">documentation
  for email_in.pl</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="v30_feat_gw"></a>Users Who Get All Bug 
  Notifications</h3>

<p>There is now a parameter called <kbd>globalwatchers</kbd>. This
  is a comma-separated list of Bugzilla users who will
  get all bug notifications generated by Bugzilla.</p>

<p>Group controls still apply, though, so users who can't see a bug
  still won't get notifications about that bug.</p>

<h3><a name="v30_feat_utf8"></a>Improved UTF-8 Support</h3>

<p>Bugzilla users running MySQL should now have excellent
  UTF-8 support if they turn on the <kbd>utf8</kbd> parameter. (New
  installs have this parameter on by default.) Bugzilla
  now correctly supports searching and sorting in non-English languages,
  including multi-bytes languages such as Chinese.</p>

<h3><a name="v30_feat_upda"></a>Automatic Update Notification</h3>

<p>If you belong to the <kbd>admin</kbd> group, you will be notified
  when you log in if there is a new release of Bugzilla
  available to download.</p>

<p>You can control these notifications by changing the 
  <kbd>upgrade_notification</kbd> parameter.</p>

<h3><a name="v30_feat_welc"></a>Welcome Page for New Installs</h3>

<p>When you log in for the first time on a brand-new Bugzilla
  installation, you will be presented with a page that describes
  where you should go from here, and what parameters you should set.</p>

<h3><a name="v30_feat_qs"></a>QuickSearch Plugin for IE7 and Firefox 2</h3>

<p>Firefox 2 users and Internet Explorer 7 users will be presented
  with the option to add Bugzilla to their search bar.
  This uses the 
  <a href="https://landfill.bugzilla.org/bugzilla-3.0-branch/page.cgi?id=quicksearch.html">QuickSearch syntax</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="v30_feat_other"></a>Other Enhancements and Changes</h3>

<p>These are either minor enhancements, or enhancements that have
  very short descriptions. Some of these are very useful, though!</p>

<h4>Enhancements That Affect Bugzilla Users</h4>

<ul>
  <li>In comments, quoted text (lines that start with <kbd>&gt;</kbd>)
    will be a different color from normal text.</li>
  <li>There is now a user preference that will add you to the CC list
    of any bug you modify. Note that it's <strong>on</strong> 
    by default.</li>
  <li>Bugs can now be filed with an initial state of 
    <kbd>ASSIGNED</kbd>, if you are in the <kbd>editbugs</kbd> group.</li>
  <li>By default, comment fields will zoom large when you are typing in them,
    and become small when you move out of them. You can disable this
    in your user preferences.</li>
  <li>You can hide obsolete attachments on a bug by clicking
    "Hide Obsolete" at the bottom of the attachment table.</li>
  <li>If a bug has flags set, and you move it to a different 
    product that has flags with the same name, the flags will be 
    preserved.</li>
  <li>You now can't request a flag to be set by somebody who can't set it
    (Bugzilla will throw an error if you try).</li>
  <li>Many new headers have been added to outbound Bugzilla
    bug emails: <code>X-Bugzilla-Status</code>,
    <code>X-Bugzilla-Priority</code>, <code>X-Bugzilla-Assigned-To</code>,
    <code>X-Bugzilla-Target-Milestone</code>, and 
    <code>X-Bugzilla-Changed-Fields</code>, <code>X-Bugzilla-Who</code>.
    You can look at an email to get an idea of what they contain.</li>
  <li>In addition to the old <code>X-Bugzilla-Reason</code> email header
    which tells you why you got an email, if you got an email because
    you were watching somebody, there is now an 
    <code>X-Bugzilla-Watch-Reason</code> header that tells you who you
    were watching and what role they had.</li>
  <li>If you hover your mouse over a full URL (like 
    <code>http://bugs.mycompany.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1212</code>) that 
    links to a bug, you will see the title of the 
    bug. Of course, this only works for bugs in your
    Bugzilla installation.</li>
  <li>If your installation has user watching enabled, you will now see
    the users that you can remove from your watch-list as a multi-select
    box, much like the current CC list. (Previously it was just a text
    box.)</li>
  <li>When a user creates their own account in Bugzilla, the 
    account is now not actually created until they verify their email
    address by clicking on a link that is emailed to them.</li>
  <li>You can change a bug's resolution without reopening it.</li>
  <li>When you view the dependency tree on a bug, resolved 
    bugs will be hidden by default. (In previous versions,
    resolved bugs were shown by default.)</li>
  <li>When viewing bug activity, fields that hold bug 
    numbers (such as "Blocks") will have the bug numbers
    displayed as links to those bugs.</li>
  <li>When viewing the "Keywords" field in a bug list,
    it will be sorted alphabetically, so you can sanely sort a list on
    that field.</li>
  <li>In most places, the Version field is now sorted using a version-sort
    (so 1.10 is greater than 1.2) instead of an alphabetical sort.</li>
  <li>Options for flags will only appear if you can set them. So, for
    example, if you can't grant <kbd>+</kbd> on a flag, that option
    won't appear for you.</li>
  <li>You can limit the product-related output of <kbd>config.cgi</kbd>
    by specifying a <kbd>product=</kbd> URL argument, containing the name
    of a product. You can specify the argument more than once for multiple
    products.</li>
  <li>You can now search the boolean charts on whether or not a comment
    is private.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Enhancements For Administrators</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Administrators can now delete attachments, making them disappear
    entirely from Bugzilla.</li>
  <li><kbd>sanitycheck.cgi</kbd> can now only be accessed by users
    in the <kbd>editcomponents</kbd> group.</li>
  <li>The "Field Values" control panel can now only be accessed
    by users in the <kbd>admin</kbd> group. (Previously it was accessible
    to anybody in the <kbd>editcomponents</kbd> group.)</li>
  <li>There is a new parameter <kbd>announcehtml</kbd>, that will allow
    you to enter some HTML that will be displayed at the top of every
    page, as an announcement.</li>
  <li>The <kbd>loginnetmask</kbd> parameter now defaults to 0 for new
    installations, meaning that as long as somebody has the right
    login cookie, they can log in from any IP address. This makes
    life a lot easier for dial-up users or other users whose IP
    changes a lot. This could be done because the login cookie is now
    very random, and thus secure.</li>
  <li>Classifications now have sortkeys, so they can be sorted in an
    order that isn't alphabetical.</li>
  <li>Authentication now supports LDAP over SSL (LDAPS) or TLS (using
    the STARTLS command) in addition to plain LDAP.</li>
  <li>LDAP users can have their LDAP username be their email address,
    instead of having the LDAP <kbd>mail</kbd> attribute be their
    email address. You may wish to set the <kbd>emailsuffix</kbd>
    parameter if you do this.</li>
  <li>Administrators can now see what has changed in a user account,
    when using the "Users" control panel.</li>
  <li><code>REMIND</code> and <code>LATER</code> are no longer part
    of the default list of resolutions. Upgrading installations will
    not be affected--they will still have these resolutions.</li>
  <li><kbd>editbugs</kbd> is now the default for the <kbd>timetrackinggroup</kbd>
    parameter, meaning that time-tracking will be on by default in a new
    installation.</li>
